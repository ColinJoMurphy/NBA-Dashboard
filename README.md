# NBA-Dashboard
An R Shiny dashboard for the 2021/2022 season. The web app scrapes data from https://www.basketball-reference.com/ and writes it to a PostgreSQL server on Google Cloud. The dashboard queries that database to display stats and plots. The web app can be accessed with this link https://cojoe.shinyapps.io/NBA_Stat_Dashboard/.
